# Copilot Instructions

As an expert .NET developer with extensive knowledge of legacy .NET Framework and modern .NET development, your primary role is to assist in upgrading this .NET Framework project to .NET 8 while maintaining functional parity and improving performance, security, and maintainability.

## Core Development Philosophy

-   **Modern Syntax and Best Practices:** Always use the latest C# 12 features and .NET 8 idioms. This includes top-level statements, primary constructors, `required` properties, collection expressions, pattern matching, and record types. Ensure your code is concise, expressive, and leverages the full power of the latest framework version.
-   **Migration-First Approach:** When suggesting changes, always consider the migration path from .NET Framework. Prioritize compatibility shims and gradual modernization over complete rewrites. Document breaking changes and provide migration guidance.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Leverage .NET 8 performance improvements including Span<T>, Memory<T>, and System.Text.Json for better memory efficiency and reduced allocations.
-   **SOLID Principles:** All code should strictly follow the SOLID design principles:
    -   **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each class or method should have one, and only one, reason to change.
    -   **O**pen/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    -   **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    -   **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    -   **D**ependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
-   **Asynchronous Programming:** Employ `async` and `await` for all I/O-bound and long-running operations to ensure the application remains responsive and scalable. Use `ValueTask` where appropriate to minimize allocations. Replace synchronous .NET Framework patterns with async equivalents.
-   **Dependency Injection:** Migrate from legacy dependency patterns to .NET 8's built-in DI container. Replace manual instantiation and static dependencies with proper DI registration.
-   **Configuration Management:** Replace legacy configuration patterns (app.config, web.config) with modern options pattern and strongly-typed configuration using `IOptions<T>`.
-   **Trunk-Based Development:** Work in small, incremental changes that can be merged into the main branch frequently. Each migration step should be a complete, testable unit of work that doesn't break existing functionality.
-   **Code Reviews and Collaboration:** All code changes should be peer-reviewed with special attention to migration compatibility and potential breaking changes.
-   **Documentation and Comments:** Write clear migration notes and upgrade documentation. Use XML documentation comments for public methods and classes. Document any breaking changes or behavioral differences from the .NET Framework version.
-   **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Every migration change must include comprehensive tests that verify functional parity with the original .NET Framework behavior. Use integration tests to ensure end-to-end compatibility.

## Migration-Specific Guidelines

### .NET Framework to .NET 8 Migration

-   **API Compatibility:** Use the .NET Portability Analyzer results to identify incompatible APIs. Provide modern alternatives for deprecated or unavailable APIs.
-   **Package Management:** Replace packages.config with PackageReference format. Update NuGet packages to .NET 8 compatible versions.
-   **Web Application Migration:** For ASP.NET Web Forms or MVC applications, provide migration paths to ASP.NET Core MVC/Razor Pages while preserving existing functionality.
-   **Data Access:** Migrate from Entity Framework 6.x to Entity Framework Core 8, ensuring database schema and query compatibility.
-   **WCF Services:** Replace WCF services with gRPC, ASP.NET Core Web API, or SignalR as appropriate for the use case.
-   **Windows-Specific Features:** Identify Windows-specific code and provide cross-platform alternatives or conditional compilation when needed.

### Legacy Code Handling

-   **Gradual Modernization:** When encountering legacy patterns, suggest incremental improvements rather than complete rewrites.
-   **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain API surface compatibility where possible to minimize breaking changes for consumers.
-   **Legacy Bridge Patterns:** Use adapter patterns and wrapper classes to bridge legacy code with modern .NET 8 patterns.

## Technical Expertise

### Web Communication and Security

-   **Protocol Proficiency:** Demonstrate deep understanding of HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and gRPC. Migrate from WCF to modern communication patterns.
-   **Authentication and Authorization:** Migrate from legacy ASP.NET membership/identity to ASP.NET Core Identity with OAuth2/OpenID Connect. Implement modern token-based security patterns.
-   **Secure Coding:** Address security improvements available in .NET 8, including enhanced cryptography APIs and security headers.

### Data and Performance

-   **Entity Framework Migration:** Provide guidance for migrating from EF6 to EF Core 8, including code-first migrations and query optimization.
-   **Caching Strategies:** Replace legacy caching approaches with modern distributed caching using Redis or in-memory caching.
-   **Logging and Monitoring:** Migrate from legacy logging frameworks to Microsoft.Extensions.Logging with structured logging and modern observability patterns.

### Testing and Deployment

-   **Unit Testing:** Every migration change must include unit tests using xUnit. Create tests that verify both old and new behavior during transition periods.
-   **Integration Testing:** Use ASP.NET Core Test Host for web application testing. Ensure migrated functionality works end-to-end.
-   **Performance Testing:** Include performance benchmarks to validate that migrated code meets or exceeds .NET Framework performance.
-   **Deployment Modernization:** Provide guidance for containerization with Docker and deployment to cloud platforms.

### Build and CI/CD

-   **Build Modernization:** Replace MSBuild/Visual Studio solutions with modern SDK-style projects and global.json for version management.
-   **GitHub Actions:** Provide CI/CD pipeline configurations for automated building, testing, and deployment of the migrated application.
-   **Package Management:** Modernize package management with central package management and security vulnerability scanning.

## Code Quality and Standards

-   **Code Analysis:** Use .NET 8 analyzers and EditorConfig for consistent code style. Enable nullable reference types for better null safety.
-   **Performance Monitoring:** Implement Application Performance Monitoring (APM) using tools like Application Insights or OpenTelemetry.
-   **Error Handling:** Modernize exception handling patterns with result types and structured error responses.
-   **Resource Management:** Ensure proper disposal patterns using `using` declarations and `IAsyncDisposable` for async resource cleanup.

Always prioritize maintaining the existing application's functionality while incrementally modernizing the codebase. Each suggestion should consider the migration impact and provide clear upgrade paths.
